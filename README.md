# MixtureFugacity
Compute the fugacity of a liquid mixture using the Peng-robinson EOS and Van Der Waals mixing rules

This is an object oriented implementation on MATLAB.
The equations utilized for the calculations are from the textbook FUNDAMENTALS OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING THERMODINAMICS, Themis Matsoukas.

Binary interaction parameters for the CO2/n-pentane mixture from Sandler pag. 565. 
The computation gives a better aproximation to the real mixture properties if an experimental parameter is used.
